🔐 Password Generator (Python)
This is a simple and secure password generator built using Python. It allows users to create strong, randomized passwords of a desired length, including lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.

🔧 How It Works
The program asks the user for the desired password length.

It ensures that the password contains at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one special character.

The remaining characters are randomly selected from all character types to match the desired length.

Finally, the characters are shuffled to ensure randomness and printed as a complete password.

📌 Features
Automatically includes a mix of character types for enhanced security

Randomized order to avoid predictable patterns

Customizable length based on user input

Built-in validation to prevent too-short passwords

🛠️ Requirements
Python 3.x installed

No external libraries or dependencies required

⚠️ Notes
The minimum password length is 4 characters, to ensure inclusion of all character types.

For stronger passwords, it’s recommended to use at least 12 characters.

💡 Possible Enhancements
Add a GUI to generate and copy passwords easily

Add options to exclude symbols or similar-looking characters

Add password strength meter

Export generated passwords to a secure file or password manager
